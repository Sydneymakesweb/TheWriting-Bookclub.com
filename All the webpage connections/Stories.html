When you go to Classic Books section, you will find over 3 million books that are “accessible,” which means they are free to read online or download. Once you find the book, you will immediately know whether you can read it online or not. Just look for the big blue “Read” button. When you hover open the headphones icon, you will be able to listen to the audio version.</p>

Not all books can be fully previewed online, but you can narrow search results to those that are. To do that, in the upper bar click on “Any view.” From a drop-down list select “Free Google eBooks” to see only the books that can be read online from the very beginning to the very end.</p>
